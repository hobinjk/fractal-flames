# Fractal Flames

Port of my super old processing sketch https://openprocessing.org/sketch/9366#

It looks like I was adapting somebody else's code so I'm not too sure of the
authorship but the general ideas behind fractal flames are covered very well on
[the wikipedia article about them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_flame).
